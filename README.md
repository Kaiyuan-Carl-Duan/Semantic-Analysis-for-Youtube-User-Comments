In this notebook, we have a dataset of user comments for youtube videos related to animals or pets. We will attempt to identify cat or dog owners 
based on these comments, and find out the topics important to them.

The dataset provided for this coding test are comments for videos related to animals and/or pets. The dataset is 240MB compressed; please download the file using this google drive link:
